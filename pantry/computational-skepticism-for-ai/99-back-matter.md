## Acknowledgments

This book grew out of a course, and the course grew out of students who would not let bad answers stand. The graduate students in INFO 7375 and INFO 7390 at Northeastern University — especially the Humanitarians AI fellows who brought real deployment problems into the room — are the reason the arguments here are as sharp as they are. They found the gaps. They forced the rewrites. The dedication is not rhetorical.

Nina Harris co-taught the branding and AI course with me and sharpened my thinking on communication, design, and what it means to make evidence legible to a non-technical reader. Several of this book's visualization arguments trace directly to her pushback on my first drafts. Charles Fadel read chapters at speed and sent back questions that improved almost every one of them. Sri Sridhar's work on engineering education — and his willingness to argue about pedagogy at length — shaped the framework chapters more than he probably realizes.

The Frictional method in Chapter 4 was developed with students, not for them. They stress-tested every failure mode I documented and found several I had not. The journal format they used is the format that survived.

The material on agentic systems draws on the red-team literature — particularly *Agents of Chaos* — and on documented post-mortems that multiple researchers made publicly available. I am grateful to everyone who writes honest failure reports. The field runs on them.

The textbook is free to read at GitHub. The slide decks and assignment scaffolds are at [bearbrown.co](https://www.bearbrown.co/). The course continues.

## Notes

Notes are grouped by chapter. Items marked **[verify before publication]** are flagged in the main text and require primary-source confirmation before final production.

---

### Chapter 1 — The Skeptic's Toolkit

1. The Swedish triage case is presented as a composite based on documented regional health-network AI deployments in Sweden circa 2018–2020. **[verify before publication]** Confirm against Lindgren et al. or substitute a fully primary-sourced case. The structural failure — a technically functioning system producing preventable harm — is documented across multiple national AI-in-triage audits; the specific death-in-waiting-room framing requires a verifiable primary source or must be recast as an explicit composite.

2. Descartes's method of radical doubt is developed primarily in *Meditations on First Philosophy* (1641), Meditation I. The operational version here — *what would have to be true for this claim to be wrong?* — is an engineering adaptation, not a direct quotation of Descartes's project.

3. Hume's argument against inductive inference is developed in *A Treatise of Human Nature* (1739–40), Book I, Part III, and more accessibly in *An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding* (1748), Section IV. The framing here follows the "problem of induction" reading standard in philosophy of science rather than Hume's own skeptical conclusions.

4. Popper's criterion of falsifiability is developed in *Logik der Forschung* (1934), published in English as *The Logic of Scientific Discovery* (1959). The application to AI metrics is the author's extension.

5. Plato's cave allegory appears in *The Republic*, Book VII, ~514a–520a.

6. Ash's email-agent case. **[verify before publication]** Attributed to Shapira et al., *Agents of Chaos: Eleven Red-Team Studies of Agentic Failure*, 2026, Case #1, "Disproportionate Response." Confirm publication details, page or case number, and whether the "Ash" pseudonym is used in the source or is introduced here.

---

### Chapter 2 — Probability, Uncertainty, and the Confidence Illusion

7. The disease-screening example — 99% accurate test, 1-in-10,000 base rate, approximately 1% posterior probability — is a standard Bayesian base-rate illustration used in probability pedagogy. The arithmetic is correct. No specific original source is cited; the example appears in multiple statistics and medical-decision-making textbooks.

8. Bayes's theorem originates in Thomas Bayes, "An Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances," *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London* 53 (1763): 370–418 (posthumous). The form used here follows standard notation.

9. The pandemic imaging case — models trained pre-2020 experiencing distribution shift in 2021–22 due to COVID-related changes in lung imaging patterns — is documented across several radiology AI audits. **[verify before publication]** Identify and cite at least one primary-source publication before final production.

10. Bjork's desirable difficulties research: the distinction between performance and learning conditions is developed across many papers. A useful primary source is Robert A. Bjork and Elizabeth Ligon Bjork, "A New Theory of Disuse and an Old Theory of Stimulus Fluctuation," in *From Learning Processes to Cognitive Processes: Essays in Honor of William K. Estes*, ed. A. F. Healy, S. M. Kosslyn, and R. M. Shiffrin (Erlbaum, 1992), 35–67. For a more accessible treatment, see Robert Bjork, "Institutional Impediments to Effective Training," in *Learning, Remembering, Believing*, ed. D. Druckman and R. Bjork (National Academy Press, 1994).

11. The Central Limit Theorem: no single original source is appropriate here; the theorem has numerous independent proofs and is standard probability curriculum. The note about Cauchy distributions and power-law exceptions is standard.

---

### Chapter 3 — Bias: Where It Enters and Who Is Responsible

12. The COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) case: the ProPublica analysis is Julia Angwin, Jeff Larson, Surya Mattu, and Lauren Kirchner, "Machine Bias," *ProPublica*, May 23, 2016. Northpointe's response is William Dieterich, Christina Mendoza, and Tim Brennan, "COMPAS Risk Scales: Demonstrating Accuracy Equity and Predictive Parity," Northpointe, July 8, 2016.

13. Pearl's causal ladder (association, intervention, counterfactual) is developed in Judea Pearl and Dana Mackenzie, *The Book of Why: The New Science of Cause and Effect* (Basic Books, 2018), especially Chapters 1 and 3. The technical apparatus is in Judea Pearl, *Causality: Models, Reasoning, and Inference*, 2nd ed. (Cambridge University Press, 2009).

---

### Chapter 4 — The Frictional Method

14. The Decoupling Problem is the author's framing; no prior source is claimed.
